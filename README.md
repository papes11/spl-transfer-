# spl-transfer-
Transfer your spl using node updated code

How to Use:
Replace "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE" with your actual Solana wallet's public key.
Replace RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_1 and RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_2 with the actual recipient addresses.
Replace YOUR_MINT_ADDRESS with the mint address for the SPL token if you're transferring an SPL token, or remove it if you're sending SOL.
Run the script with node sendTransaction.js (after ensuring you have Node.js installed and the necessary packages).
This Node.js script directly interacts with the Solana blockchain to perform the transactions.
